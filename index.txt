Hello, I am Navya Devineni, you can call me Navya. I have enrolled for Spring Batch working on my Masters in Applied Computer Science to improve my coding skills.

I am from Vijayawada,India. I have done my bachelors in 2018 from Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I worked as a Software Developer at CMOS Research Labs. Well coming to my hobbies, I like to play badminton, listen songs and watch web series.

My future plan is to work as a Salesforce developer, after I complete Master's. There are few technologies like Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence in which I want to get familiar with.

There's nothing much to say about me.

Hope you'll have a great time.
